## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Run Migrations

Create the database tables for notification preferences:

```bash
# Activate virtual environment
myenv\Scripts\activate

# Create and run migrations
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

### Step 2: Configure Email Settings

Ensure your `.env` file has email configuration (Gmail, Outlook, or Mailgun):

**For Gmail:**
```env
GMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=your-app-specific-password
```

**For Outlook:**
```env
EMAIL_HOST_USER=your-email@outlook.com
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=your-password
EMAIL_HOST=smtp-mail.outlook.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USE_TLS=True
```

### Step 3: Test Email Notifications

Test the notification system manually:

```bash
# Send alerts to a specific user
python manage.py send_delivery_alerts --user=your_username

# Dry run (see what would be sent without sending)
python manage.py send_delivery_alerts --dry-run

# Send to all users with alerts
python manage.py send_delivery_alerts
```

### Step 4: Schedule Daily Alerts

#### Option A: Windows Task Scheduler (Recommended for Windows)

1. Open **Task Scheduler** (search in Start menu)
2. Click **Create Basic Task**
3. Name: "DiecastCollector Daily Alerts"
4. Trigger: **Daily** at your preferred time (e.g., 9:00 AM)
5. Action: **Start a program**
   - Program: `C:\Users\PC\Documents\Model_car_inventory\myenv\Scripts\python.exe`
   - Arguments: `manage.py send_delivery_alerts`
   - Start in: `C:\Users\PC\Documents\Model_car_inventory`
6. Check "Open Properties dialog" and click Finish
7. In Properties, check "Run whether user is logged on or not"
8. Click OK and enter your Windows password

#### Option B: Manual Script

Create a batch file `send_alerts.bat`:

```batch
@echo off
cd /d C:\Users\PC\Documents\Model_car_inventory
call myenv\Scripts\activate
python manage.py send_delivery_alerts
pause
```

Double-click to run manually or schedule with Task Scheduler.

if success:
    print("Email sent successfully")
```

#### Check User Notification Preferences

```python
from inventory.models import NotificationPreferences

prefs = NotificationPreferences.get_or_create_for_user(user)

if prefs.email_overdue_alerts:
    # User wants overdue alerts
    pass
```

## Customization

### Change Alert Timing

Edit the default in `models.py`:

```python
alert_days_before_delivery = models.IntegerField(
    default=3,  # Change this value
    help_text='How many days before delivery to send upcoming alerts'
)
```

### Modify Email Templates

Templates are located in:
- HTML: `inventory/templates/inventory/emails/delivery_alert_email.html`

## Best Practices

1. **Enable email verification** before sending notifications
2. **Set up proper email authentication** (SPF, DKIM) to avoid spam filters
3. **Test notifications** in development before production
4. **Monitor email delivery rates** and adjust as needed
5. **Respect user preferences** - always check before sending
6. **Keep email content concise** and actionable
7. **Include unsubscribe options** for compliance
