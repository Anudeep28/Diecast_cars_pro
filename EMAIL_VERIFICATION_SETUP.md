# Email Verification Implementation Guide

## Overview
Added email verification functionality for new user registrations. Users must verify their email address before proceeding to payment.

## What Changed

### 1. **New Model: EmailVerificationToken**
- Stores verification tokens for each new user
- Tokens expire after 24 hours
- Tracks verification status

### 2. **Updated Registration Flow**
**Before:** Register â†’ Payment â†’ Account Active  
**After:** Register â†’ Email Sent â†’ Verify Email â†’ Payment â†’ Account Active

### 3. **New Views & URLs**
- `email_verification_sent` - Shows "check your email" page
- `verify_email/<token>` - Handles email verification link
- `proceed_to_payment/<user_id>` - Shows payment page after verification

### 4. **Email Templates**
- `email_verification_email.html` - Verification email sent to users
- `email_verification_sent.html` - Page shown after registration

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Create Database Migrations
Run these commands to update your database:

```bash
# Activate virtual environment (if not already active)
myenv\Scripts\activate

# Create migration for the new model
python manage.py makemigrations inventory

# Apply the migration
python manage.py migrate
```

### Step 2: Configure Email Backend
Make sure you have email configured in your `.env` file. Choose one:

#### Option A: Gmail (Recommended for Development)
```env
GMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=your-app-specific-password
```

**How to get Gmail App Password:**
1. Go to Google Account Settings
2. Security â†’ 2-Step Verification (must be enabled)
3. App passwords â†’ Generate new password
4. Copy the 16-character password to `.env`

#### Option B: Outlook/Microsoft 365
```env
EMAIL_HOST_USER=your-email@outlook.com
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=your-password
EMAIL_HOST=smtp-mail.outlook.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USE_TLS=True
```

#### Option C: Mailgun (Production)
```env
MAILGUN_SMTP_USERNAME=your-username
MAILGUN_SMTP_PASSWORD=your-password
MAILGUN_SENDER_EMAIL=noreply@yourdomain.com
```

### Step 3: Test the Flow

1. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```
   Or double-click `run_server.bat`

2. **Register a new user:**
   - Go to `http://localhost:8000/register/`
   - Fill in the registration form
   - Submit

3. **Check your email:**
   - You should receive a verification email
   - Click the "Verify My Email Address" button
   - Or copy/paste the verification link

4. **Complete payment:**
   - After verification, you'll be redirected to the payment page
   - Complete the payment process
   - Your account will be activated

## User Experience Flow

### Registration Process:
```
1. User visits /register/
   â†“
2. Fills in: Username, Email, Password, First/Last Name
   â†“
3. Clicks "Register" button
   â†“
4. System creates inactive user account
   â†“
5. System generates unique verification token (expires in 24h)
   â†“
6. System sends verification email
   â†“
7. User sees "Check Your Email" page
```

### Email Verification:
```
1. User checks email inbox
   â†“
2. Opens verification email from DiecastCollector Pro
   â†“
3. Clicks "Verify My Email Address" button
   â†“
4. Browser opens verification link
   â†“
5. System validates token (checks if not expired)
   â†“
6. System marks email as verified
   â†“
7. User redirected to payment page
```

### Payment & Activation:
```
1. User sees Razorpay payment form
   â†“
2. Enters payment details (â‚¹99 monthly subscription)
   â†“
3. Completes payment
   â†“
4. System verifies payment with Razorpay
   â†“
5. System creates subscription record
   â†“
6. System activates user account
   â†“
7. User can now log in and access dashboard
```

## Security Features

âœ… **Token Expiration**: Verification links expire after 24 hours  
âœ… **One-Time Use**: Tokens are marked as used after verification  
âœ… **Secure Random Tokens**: Uses Python's `secrets` module  
âœ… **Email Validation**: Checks email uniqueness during registration  
âœ… **Inactive Users**: Users remain inactive until payment confirmed  
âœ… **Automatic Cleanup**: Expired users can be deleted if needed

---

## Admin Panel

The new model is registered in Django admin:
- Access at: `http://localhost:8000/admin/`
- View all verification tokens
- Check verification status
- See expiration times
- Manually verify emails if needed

---

## Troubleshooting

### Email Not Sending?
1. **Check console output** - If no email backend configured, emails print to console
2. **Check `.env` file** - Ensure email credentials are correct
3. **Check spam folder** - Verification emails might be in spam
4. **Gmail blocking?** - Use App Password, not regular password
5. **Port blocked?** - Some ISPs block port 587, try port 465 with SSL

### Token Expired?
- Users must register again
- Expired tokens automatically invalidate
- System deletes inactive user if token expires

### Already Verified?
- If user clicks verification link again, they're redirected to payment
- No error shown, just info message

### Payment Failed?
- User account remains inactive
- Can retry payment from subscription renewal page
- Contact admin to manually activate if needed

---

## Testing in Development

### Console Email Backend (No SMTP Setup)
If you don't configure any email service, Django will print emails to console:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

When user registers, verification email will appear in terminal output.  
Copy the verification URL from console and paste in browser.

---

## Production Considerations

1. **Email Service**: Use reliable service (Mailgun, SendGrid, AWS SES)
2. **Email Deliverability**: Configure SPF, DKIM records for your domain
3. **Rate Limiting**: Add rate limiting to prevent email abuse
4. **Monitoring**: Track verification rates and email delivery
5. **Cleanup Job**: Schedule task to delete expired unverified users
6. **Error Logging**: Log email sending failures for debugging

---

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

- [ ] Resend verification email button
- [ ] Email change verification for existing users
- [ ] Notification preferences
- [ ] Welcome email after payment
- [ ] Admin notifications for new registrations

---

## Questions?

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check Django server console for errors
2. Check email credentials in `.env`
3. Verify migrations are applied: `python manage.py showmigrations`
4. Check admin panel for token status
5. Review user account status in admin

**Implementation Complete! ðŸŽ‰**

Your application now requires email verification before payment, improving security and ensuring valid email addresses for all users.
